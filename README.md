# Remarkable email to Notion

I like control of my data and utilizing what is already free to me. This project is not intended to replace services such as [https://taskrobin.io/](taskrobin.io). (Although, I think there might be a security issue as remarkable sends from the same email address.)

## Overall scope
1. Send an email from remarkable (Attachment or Text)
2. Receive email from AmazonSES (which stores it in S3)
3. Use Lambda to process the file in S3 and Upload it to Notion
